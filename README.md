<br><br><br>**Disclaimer: This program will encrypt the data in the folder and all the subfolders in which you're running it from and there are chances that you might not be able to recover your data. Run it in a Virtual Machine. DO NOT RUN IT IN YOUR MACHINE UNLESS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE THE FOLDER IN WHICH THE REPO EXISTS DO NOT CONTAIN ANY IMPORTANT DATA.**  
<p>KMike, named after Krombopulos Michael, is a ransomware that can help people understand the mechanics of a ransomware.</p>
<p>It is written in Python, contrary to C or C++, which are supposed to be the languages for malware programming. Python was chosen because of its readability and beginner friendly nature.</p>
<p>The ransomware design intentionally includes some choices to deter people from using it for nefarious purposes.</p>
